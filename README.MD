## Installation Process (IMPORTANT):

    1. Pull from branch main on github repo

    3. Create a file called config.json inside vibra/. Add your local WIFI IP Adress there like 
        {
            "MY_IP": "XXX.XXX.XX"
        }
    4. Start server by running: `npm run start`
    5. NOTE: Ideally, create a new branch by your name i.e. 'Johannes' and work and commit on this branch.
